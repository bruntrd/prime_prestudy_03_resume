			<button class="expbut">What he's been doing?</button>
      <p class="exp">Most recently Ryan was working at the DRC, also knows as the Data Recognition Corporation.  There he did some work reading open ended questions on standardized tests.  They have yet to come up with a way for computers to accomplish this, so they take qualified individuals, like Ryan, to make judgements on a variety of different open ended tests.  Ryan worked on high school graduation tests for some states as well as other projects.<br>
			For most of 2014 Ryan was working as a Business Developement Representative for Epicor Software.  Epicor is a ERP software company with over 900 million in revenue. While there Ryan spoke with C-level Executives about new software projects, helping them find the right software solution for their company.<br>
      The previous few years Ryan spent the summers working at Cardinal Glass Industries.  Performing basic duties getting the glass ready for shipment.  During the winters he worked as a substitute teacher in Bemidji, MN.  Substitute teaching was a great experience to help learn all kinds of problem solving skills in different situations.  Teaching grades anywhere from k-12 provided a different challenge each day.</p>

         <p class="acc">Ryan's main focus since 2010 has been curling. Yeah that kind of funny sport with the rocks on ice and the people yelling all the time.  Ryan joined up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Fenson">Pete Fenson<a/> with goal of making the 2014 Olympics.  They came up a game short, losing the final.  Though the loss was tough, the team accomplished alot in those 4 years.  Including two national championships, a runner up finish in, and the runner up finish at the Olympic Trials.  Ryan is still curling, now part of the newly developed High Performance Program.

          <p class="ski">When it comes to computer skills Ryan's got a good understanding of all the Microsoft Office programs.  Like almost everyone now, he's been using those programs since he was a kid and its almost second nature.  Other than those Salesforce CRM was used in plenty at Epicor and most recently he has began to learn the basics of front end software developement.  Including HTML, CSS, JS, and Jquery.</p>
